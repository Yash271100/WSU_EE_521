# WSU_EE_521
This repo is aimed at giving solutions of homework problems given to myself while attending the WSU as a PhD scholar, attending power system analysis and operations course by Prof. Saeed L.

# Some codes are problem specific. These are meant to be used as cross check method for the problems solved by hand as part of assignment.
